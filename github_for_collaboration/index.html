      <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

      <p>
        The magic of GitHub is providing a structure and space for communicating about those changes, making decisions, assigning tasks. With some good set-up, you can making your project accessible and transparent, and create a respectful and productive working environment for your collaborators.

        This exercise walks you through a workflow for collaboration on open projects and demonstrates good communication with contributors.

        Before you start, provide your partner with a link to your repository. Your repo should look something like this (with your own content, of course).
      </p>

      <h2 id="steps-to-complete">Steps to Complete</h2>

      <ol class="steps">
        <!-- Step 1 -->
        <li>
          <h1>Add Files</h1>
          <p>
            As project lead: add any new files you've created to your repo (readme.md, roadmap.md, contributing.md). Give the file a name, and the .md extension so you can use markdown for formatting. Add your content and click commit at the bottom.
          </p>
        </li>
        <!-- Step 2 -->
        <li>
          <h1>Make a Label</h1>
          <p>
            As project lead: Make a new label. Click the "Issues" tab, then look for the labels tab, just to the right of the "filter" box. Add a label called "good first bugs."
            <img src="img/repo-labels.png"></img>
          </p>
        </li>

        <!-- Step 3 -->
        <li>
          <h1>Make An Issue</h1>
          <p>
            As project lead: create an issue in your own repo to document a "good first bug". A good first bug is something simple that a new contributor can work on, to give contribution and this way of working a try. It's work that's useful to the project but relatively easy, not so difficult as to be overwhelming or discouraging for someone new to your project. A good first bug is as much an opportunity to learn the workflow as it is to make changes to the project. An example of a good first bug for this exercise: fix a typo in the readme, add a badge, add a science fox, etc.

          </p>
        </li>

        <!-- Step 4 -->
        <li>
          <h1>Comment On An Issue </h1>
          <p>
            As contributor: Go to your partner's repo, find the "Good First Bug" issue, and comment on the that issue... introduce yourself and volunteer to work on this issue! In your own repo, go to the issue that's just been commented on.

        </li>

        <li>
          <h1>Reply to a Comment </h1>
          <p>
            As project lead: In your own repo, go to the issue that's just been commented on. Reply to your new contributor and assign this issue to yourself (you should act as a mentor, and offer to anser any questions). Assigning issues is a good way to track which tasks are underway and have help.

        </li>

        <li>
          <h1>Fork and Branch</h1>
          <p>
            As contributor: Go to your partner's repo and fork it. Then create a branch in your forked copy. Name this branch.

          <h1>Commit </h1>
          <p>
            As contributor: Make a change in this branch, and commit it. Write a great commit message! The top line should summarize your changes. Include details in the field below.

You could also invite other collaboraters to review or weigh in. Make use of gifs and emoticons here, to emphasize your appreciation!
