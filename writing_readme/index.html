      <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

      <p>
        When you open your project you may have a specific audience in mind (software developers, other researchers in your field) but actually by working openly you're inviting in everyone, and you may be surprised by who wants to contribute! You may be looking for help with code, but you may find also need designers, technical writers, citizen scientists-- lots of people who are well outside your field of study, with a mix of backgrounds. The readme file clearly communicates key information about your project in clear and simple language that anyone, from almost every background, can understand.</p>

        <p>The readme is part of a collection of documents (contributing, roadmap, Code of Conduct) that should make everyone (especially potential contributors) feel welcome to your project and encouraged to get involved. The Readme is the first thing anyone sees when the come to the project, so it's one of the most important project documents you will write!</p>

        <p>The following steps are designed to help you clarify your project description and goals, and communicate clearly. First, you'll use Open Canvas to help define and organize the goals, potential value, and needs for your project. Then you'll write a readme and test it for clarity of language, using a tool that encourages you to communicate using only the ten hundred most common words in the English language.</p>
</p>

      <h2 id="steps-to-complete">Steps to Complete</h2>

      <ol class="steps">
        <!-- Step 1 -->
        <li>
          <h1>Create an Open Canvas for your project</h1>
          <p>
            Open Canvas is a tool that is adapted from Lean Canvas, a one-page structure used for describing a start-up business project. Open Canvas helps you state clearly the problem you are trying to solve, the solution you propose, and what is especially valuable about your open project. It also helps you define your users and contributors, measurements of success, and the resources you'll need.

            <img src="../handouts/img/badges_open_canvas.jpg">

        <!-- Step 2 -->
        <li>
          <h1>Write</h1>
          <p>
            Using the information you gathered in the Open Canvas exercise, write your Readme.md file. Be sure to:
            <ol>
            <li>Say hello and welcome people to the project.</li>
            <li>Show what you're doing, for who, and why. </li>
            <li>Explain what makes your project special, useful, exciting. How is it different or new? </li>
            <li>Show how to get started using or developing on your project</li>
            <li> and state what resources and contributions you're looking for</li>
            <li>Finally point to outher resources: especially your contributing.md file, your roadmap.</li>
          </ol>
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h1>Remove Jargon!</h1>
          <p>
            Take the section of your readme where you describe your project (what you're doing, for who, and why), and drop it into the Up-Goer 5 text editor. Try to communicate your project using only those common words. This is a great way to identify technical language that may be confusing to newcomers, and try out expressing yourself as simple language as possible. Here's an example of of a rocket ship diagram communciated in common language.

            In your final readme text, you don't need to stick only to these most common words--if you do, you may find that your project description becomes overly simplified. This step is designed to encourage you to get rid of any jargon.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h1>Re-write</h1>
          <p>
            Re-write your entire readme in clear language and define all terms. Share your readme with your public.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2 id="glossary">Glossary</h2>
      <section class="glossary">
        <section class="term">
          <h3>Readme file</h3>
          <p>
            The readme file is a document included in a project's collection working files that introduces the project to the public and any potential contributors.
